%Membership Classes and Eligibility
\sec{Membership Classes and Eligibility}

There shall be three classes of Membership: “Individual Adult Membership”, “Individual Youth Membership”, and “Family Membership”. Where these Bylaws refer to “Member” without specifying, all membership classes are meant. Membership records shall be processed and maintained by the Vice President (VP). 

\subsec{Individual Adult Memberships}

Individual Adult Members are Adults.

\subsec{Individual Youth Memberships}
Individual Youth Members are Youths who may be a member with full privileges with their parent or legal guardian as their representative to the Club. An Individual Youth Member’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) are not required to be Club members, but may attend club meetings.

\subsec{Family Memberships}

Family Memberships consist of up to six members of the same immediate family, and shall designate a Family Representative to act as the primary contact between BayLUG and the family. The Family Representative shall be an Adult. The family members shall designate their Family Representative in writing to the Vice President. The family is considered to have one membership. A family membership can not consist of just one person. 

\subsec{Initial Eligibility for Membership}

Individuals and families are eligible for Membership on fulfillment of all of: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Payment of initial dues. 
    \item Acceptance and espousal of the Club Bylaws. 
    \item Submitting a completed application for membership providing needed information. 
    \item Acceptance and approval of the application by any member of the Executive Committee. 
\end{enumerate}

There is no geographic or residency requirement. The Club welcomes members from anywhere. 

\subsec{Retention of Eligibility for Membership}
\label{subsec:retain-eligibility}

Members retain eligibility by the: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prompt payment of dues; before or during the first meeting of the current calendar year. 
    \item Compliance with all other requirements set forth in these Bylaws.
\end{enumerate}

Loss of eligibility shall be corrected within 60 days, or may be grounds for involuntary termination of membership. 

\subsec{Member Conduct (in person and online)}

All Members 15 years old and under shall be directly supervised by their parent or legal guardian at all times at club functions. The Member’s parents or legal guardian are responsible for their children’s conduct, and fully liable for any and all damages caused by their children. 
All Members 16 to 17 years old do not require a parent or legal guardian in attendance, but the Member’s parents or legal guardian are responsible for their children’s conduct, and fully liable for any and all damages caused by their children. 

All Members 18 years old and older are responsible for their own conduct and are personally responsible for any and all damages they may cause. 

\subsec{Grandfathering of Current Members}

At the time of acceptance of these Bylaws, all current Club Members are deemed to have satisfied the eligibility requirements, but remain subject to the eligibility retention requirements. These bylaws supersede any and all previous agreements about membership \& dues policies. 

%Termination of Membership
\sec{Termination of Membership}

\subsec{Membership Voluntary Termination}
Any Member in good standing may apply for voluntary membership termination at any time by postal or electronic mail notice to the Vice President. The VP shall deem such notice accepted on evidence of return of all Club property and satisfaction of all obligations and shall strike the Member from the Roll of Club Members. 

\subsec{Membership Automatic Termination}
Any Member who has not paid their dues for the current calendar year before or during the annual members meeting will have their membership automatically terminated for lack of payment of dues.

\subsec{Membership Involuntary Termination}
Any Member who is not in good standing (as defined under \ref{subsec:retain-eligibility}) shall be considered ineligible, and shall be involuntarily terminated. 

At the discretion of the Executive Committee, the Member may be given a final chance to rectify their ineligibility. Subsequent to the determination of the status of that Member, the Executive Committee shall vote for or against their termination. A simple majority of Executive Committee votes in favor of termination shall terminate their membership. 

The Vice President shall give notice to the Member via postal or electronic mail to the address of record of the Member, which shall be deemed sufficient notice. 

If the Executive Committee chooses not to pursue termination of an ineligible Member when the ineligibility first occurs, it does not waive any right to do so in future. Involuntary Termination shall bar the individual from ever rejoining the Club unless by a majority vote of the Executive Committee (to be held at the request of the terminated member). 

\subsec{Family Membership Termination}
Two or more individuals that comprise a family membership, except the Family Representative, may be voluntarily or involuntarily terminated without affecting the membership of the rest of the family. If the Family Representative is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated, the family may select a new Family Representative or may leave the Club as a whole. 

\subsec{Terminated Membership Dues}
If a Member’s membership is terminated their dues and fees paid are forfeited in their entirety. There are no pro-rated dues or fees refunds. 

\subsec{Club and Member property}
Lent property, both Member property loaned to club and club property loaned to Member, should be returned. The terminated Member must also return name badge. Termination does not release the Member from obligations to the Club such as, but not limited to, return of Club property. 

\subsec{Reinstatement}
If a Member’s membership is terminated involuntarily, they may petition for reinstatement to the Executive committee, which would need to have a majority vote to approve the reinstatement. Members that were automatically terminated can be reinstated if they pay the delinquent dues and get majority approval from the Executive Committee.

In the event that a quorum is not met, the election shall be ruled invalid, and a new election shall be called for the next available opportunity. 

\subsec{Votes Required} 
All Members in good standing as of the commencement of the voting period shall be eligible to cast ballots in all club votes, regardless of the purpose of the vote. Officers shall be selected by a majority of the ballots cast. In the case of a tie for plurality, a runoff ballot shall be held between the two nominees named the highest number of ballots. Other member votes shall require 50\% plus 1 vote to pass, unless otherwise defined in these bylaws.
